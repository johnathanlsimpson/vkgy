                                            [message] => [Addition] Added member statistics area to user profiles. Probably need to add/adjust in the future. Also need to adjust basis for overall level. Also need to move styles to main stylsheet when done.
[Change] Made account editing obscured by default. Need to work on performance.
[Change] Added avatar to user profile header, changed color of header. Need to add placeholders for empty user details.
[Change] Removed collection stats from user profiles, since redundant. Need to continue adjusting this section for performance.
