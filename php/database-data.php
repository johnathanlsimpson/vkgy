At any rate, after Misaki ended his band activity in 2011, MEDIA HEARTS found success peddling ~~bullshit~~ health drinks of the &ldquo;[this kale will give you energy](https://myfabius.jp/)&rdquo; variety.

They seem to be a live production/band support company that popped up in 2015, and has so far only worked with older musicians (eg. MORRIE). Their only connections to LIN seem to be this release and a March 2016 live at which LIN members will hold a session band. The company seems to be often involved in goods production, so I wonder if they facilitated the production of this box set. I also wonder if they&#39;re related to HAUNTED HOUSE RECORDS, which was a sublabel of UNDER CODE PRODUCTION created exclusively for the release of [FLESH FOR FLANKENSTEIN][2].

(703, 'About romanization on vkgy', '@Laurence02 has been requesting a romaji style guide for a while now, so I decided to finally type one up, based purely on my own system/justifications.\n\nIf you&#39;re someone who actually cares how stuff is romanized, feel free to give it a lookover and share your thoughts&#12540;I&#39;m willing to change how I do it based on the majority opinion.\n\nIn the future, I&#39;ll open up this discussion on Discord, and then post it to the normal blog/add it to the documentation sections.\n\n---\n\nWhen adding data to [vkgy](https://vk.gy/), a hybrid form of romanization is encouraged (but not required):\n\n---\n\n## Basic romanization\n\nModified Hepburn is recommended for general use. However, when dealing with long vowels, Wapuro is recommended. For example, &#12362;&#22985;&#12373;&#12435; would be *oneesan*, rather than on&#275;san.\n\nAs visual kei artists often use typographic symbols within their names and titles for effect, and this method preserves only those symbols that the artists intended. In general, communicating intent is favored over exact pronunciation.\n\n(This method is also much easier and faster for users who have trouble typing accents and the such.)\n\n---\n\n## Symbols\n\nWhen possible, it&#39;s recommended that &ldquo;localization&rdquo; of symbols be avoided. That is, if a song title uses &ldquo;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&rdquo; (middle dots), then middle dots should be used in the romanization. As a rule of thumb, if a symbol has no pronunciation, it should be kept the same in the romanization.\n\nAvoid introducing typographic symbols that are not present in the original Japanese, such as hyphens, apostrophes, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Loan words and translations\n\nIn general, it&#39;s recommended that loan words be romanized to their original form. In this case, &#12475;&#12540;&#12521;&#12540; would be *sailor*. Again, this is mainly to convey intent.\n\nHowever, pure romanizations are preferred for *non*-loan words, such as counters or &ldquo;chapters.&rdquo;\n\n---\n\n## Capitalization\n\nIt&#39;s recommended that hiragana (&#12402;&#12425;&#12364;&#12394;) be written in lowercase, and katakana (&#12459;&#12479;&#12459;&#12490;) be written in UPPERCASE. This has no academic basis and is purely for aesthetic reasons; visual kei artists often switch between the two for aesthetics, and there&#39;s not a great way to represent that in roman characters.\n\nAside from katakana, general Latin-language rules are suggested; capitalize first letter and names, leave prepositions lowercase, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Archaic Japanese\n\nFor obscure Japanese, the extended kana recommended by Hepburn are typically preferred.\n\nFor archaic Japanese, it&#39;s recommended that the phrase be romanized how it would be pronounced. For example, &#12390;&#12405;&#12390;&#12405; is actually an archaic way to write *chouchou* (and this is the recommended romanization), despite that those characters would be read tefutefu now.\n\nSimilarly, see the notes for this (1230)/mona lisa/ demotape, in which the first track is romanized differently than its characters would suggest:\nhttps://vk.gy/releases/mona-lisa/5901/walpurgis-no-yoru-no-yume/\n\nIn weird cases like these, where there might be confusion as to why something was romanized a certain way, it&#39;s recommended that an explanatory note or comment be left.\n\n---\n\n## Official romaji\n\nOfficial romanizations should generally take precedence over the previous rules&#12540;but note that iTunes romanizations (etc.) are often done by third parties.\n\n---\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThis is the preferred method for romanizing content on vkgy, but it&#39;s certainly not the &ldquo;most correct&rdquo;&#12540;it&#39;s simply what works best for preserving the ridiculous artistry of visual kei bands.\n\nFeel free to let this guide your own romanizations, and feel free to edit past romanizations to fit more closely with this style guide. However, please *don&#39;t* use this an excuse to argue with others.\n\nIf you&#39;re every unsure about something you&#39;ve added to the database, please use the &ldquo;needs review&rdquo; or &ldquo;needs romaji&rdquo; tags, or leave a comment and ask someone for help.\n\nAnd lastly, as this site is collaborative in nature, please feel free to make suggestions as to how we can improve this system.', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, '2019-02-20 12:51:29', NULL, 'about-romanization-on-vkgy'),
