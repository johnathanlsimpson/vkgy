## Markdown basics

* “Markdown” is type of code that allows you to format your text when adding blog posts or comments.

 {*This band* is **awesome**. I had to [Google](https://google.com/) them.}

* Lists are easy, and you can easily separate sections with lines, if you want:

 {* List
* List

---

1. Another
1. List}



## Special vkgy Markdown

* [vkgy](https://vk.gy/) has its own special version of Markdown that has additional features.

 If you want to link a band, type its name in /slashes/, and the system will attempt to link the correct band. You can use Japanese or romaji, and you don't have to capitalize or include symbols—the system will pull those automatically.

 {/la sadies/ and /sugar forkful/ sound nothing alike.}

* You can even link an artist while displaying a different name, by following the /slashes/ with the [display name]:

 {/inspire/ used to be called /inspire/[Ruin's;lave].}

* You can reference other vkgy users with an @:

 {@inartistic}



## Embeds

* You can embed images, and give them a title if you'd like.

 {![You can also leave the brackets blank, if you want.](https://vk.gy/images/4614-omikuji-group-shot.jpg)}

* Easily embed release information from vkgy, or tweets, or YouTube videos, just by pasting the link:
