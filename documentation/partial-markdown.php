## Markdown basics

* “Markdown” is type of code that allows you to format your text when adding blog posts or comments.

 {*This band* is **awesome**. I had to [Google](https://google.com/) them.}

* Lists are easy, and you can easily separate sections with lines, if you want:

 ''* List\n* List\n\n---\n\n1. Another\n1. List,, ''→,, [[<ul class="ul--compact"><li>List</li><li>List</li></ul><hr /><ol class="ul--compact"><li>Another</li><li>List</li></ol>]]



## Linking articles

* [vkgy](https://vk.gy/) has its own special version of Markdown that has additional features.

 To generate an artist link, type its name in ''/slashes/,,, and the system will do the rest. In most areas, as soon as you type the first ''/,,, the system will offer autocomplete suggestions.

 You can use Japanese or romaji, and don't have to capitalize or include symbols—the system will pull those automatically.

 Note that, when editing a page, artist links will appear like this: ''(123)/band name/,,. The ''(123),, is the numeric link to the artist; but the system will add that part automatically, as long as you've used ''/slashes/,,.

 {/la sadies/ and /sugar forkful/ sound nothing alike.}

* You can even link an artist while displaying a different name, by following the /slashes/ with the [display name]:

 {/inspire/ used to be called /inspire/[Ruin's;lave].}

* Linking to labels is the same as linking to artists, but you use ''=,, instead, ''=like this=,,. Again, in most places, as soon as you type ''=,,, the autocomplete will start working.

 Also like artists, you can link to a label while displaying a different name, if you want.

 ''=soleil matina= sometimes called itself =soleil matina=[MATINA].,, ''→,, [[<a class="symbol__company" href="/labels/soleil-matina/">Soleil Matina</a> sometimes called itself <a class="symbol__company" href="/labels/soleil-matina/">MATINA</a>.]]

* You can reference other vkgy users with an @:

 {@inartistic}



## Embeds

* You can embed images, and give them a title if you'd like.

 ''![You can also leave the brackets blank, if you want.](https://vk.gy/images/4614-omikuji-group-shot.jpg),,

 ![You can also leave the brackets blank, if you want.](https://vk.gy/images/4614-omikuji-group-shot.jpg)

* Easily embed release information from vkgy, or tweets, or YouTube videos, just by pasting the link:
