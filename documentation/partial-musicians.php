## Adding musicians

* Use the musician's real name (or most common name) and most common position.

* Each musician must belong to at least one artist that's already in the database. See: **Band history**.



## Editing musicians

* To edit a musician's name, band history—or additional details such as blood type—navigate to the 'edit artist' page for any band of which he's a member.

* ''birth date,, can accept the following formats: ''yyyy,,, ''yyyy-mm,,, ''yyyy-mm-dd,,, ''mm-dd,,. Years are also accepted in imperial calendar format.

 ''✔,, 1977-06-31, H6-03-28, 04-16

* ''blood type,, accepts any input (i.e. custom blood types are allowed).

* Staff can be indicated by changing the musician's position to ''staff,,. You can give further context in the ''custom position,, section (e.g. roadie).



## Band history

* This section contains a musician's entire band history, and is how the musicians and artists get linked within the database.

* Each line in the band ''band history,, represents an era in time, from earliest band at the top, to most-recent band at the bottom.

 A new line (or era) is made when the musician leaves one band and joins another, or when he changes names or position within the band.

* Using vkgy's special ''/slash/,, notation (see **Markdown**), you can link the musician to the bands within his band history.

 For bands that *aren't* in the database yet, you can leave them as plain text (romanized name first, followed by the Japanese).

 If multiple bands occurred at the same time, separate them with commas.

 {/sugar forkful/\n /la sadies/, Doku yori CHOCO (毒よりチョコ)}

* Since one-off sessions don't typically count as an “era,” they should be put roughly where they occurred in the timeline, but separated by a pipe. These sessions will be displayed separately.

 Ongoing sessions can be treated like normal bands.

 {/dali/ | 123 SESSION, ABC SESSION\n /anti feminism/}

* Use (notes) when a musician changes name or position, if he is a roadie or support member, etc. Keep notes specific and use multiple notes if necessary.

 {/Dali/ (roadie)\n /Dali/ (on vocals) (support) (as Mr. ReNN)\n /DIR EN GREY/ (?), (president of Matina)\n /Arc/ (as R.E.N.)\n(retired)}

* If the musician is not in a *currently active* band, the last line of his band history should be blank; the system will intepret this as “current activity unknown.”

 If the musician is retired or deceased, that should be indicated on the last line instead.

 ''/dali/\n&nbsp;,, or ''/dali/\n(retired),,
