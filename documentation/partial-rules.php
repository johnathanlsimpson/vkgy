## General rules

* Please be kind and respectful when commenting or interacting. This extends to both users and artists. No bullying, racism, or similar jerk behavior.

* We recommend avoiding discussions about whether a band counts as vkei, and other similarly controversial subjects. Such discussions tend to be circular, unproductive, and inflaming. If you feel that you *must* discuss such a subject, please be respectful and avoid insulting other users.

* All rules on this page also apply to our Discord (and other communities).

* If you have an issue, please contact any moderator on the [users page](https://vk.gy/users/).
