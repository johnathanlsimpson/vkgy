## Which artists are allowed

[vkgy](https://vk.gy/) is for visual kei. However, the following may be added under certain conditions:

---

* ''non-visual,, must play at vk lives, and/or appear in vk omnibuses, and/or connect to a vk band/label.
* ''proto-visual,, must connect to a vk band/label, and/or have played with early vk bands, and/or be *demonstrabily* influential to vk.
* ''foreign,, must self-declare as vk, *and* appear somewhat visual, *and* be tangibly active (live concerts, paid releases).
* ''doujin,, must self-declare as vk, *and* have vk-esque artwork, *and* be tangibly active (paid releases).

---

In all cases, please use artist tags and descriptions appropriately. [Ask us](https://discord.gg/jw8jzXn) if you have questions.



## Which name should be used

* Use the “most official” name, including all symbols and decoration, even if it's annoying.

 ''❌,, The Gazette, Cali Gari ''✔,, the GazettE, cali≠gari, CμЯЁ-βLAST

* When romanizing, keep all symbols, letters, and numbers intact when possible (see **[Romaji]()**). If an official romanization exists, use that instead.

 ''name,, サリィ。 ''romaji,, SALLY。 / ''name,, 愛狂います。 ''official romaji,, aicle。

* A ''friendly,, name is generated, containing only letters, numbers, and hyphens. It can be changed when editing an artist's page, and may use an easier/more common spelling of the artist's name.

 The ''friendly,, name may also be used to differentiate artists: see **Bands with the same name**.

 ''name,, 大日本鬼端児組 悪童会に占拠され ゴシップ ''romaji,, Dainippon Onitanjigumi Akudoukai ni Senkyosare GOSSIP ''friendly,, gossip



## Bands with the same name

* Two bands with the same name can be differentiated via their ''friendly,, name. You can add things like area active, year formed, significant member, etc.

 ''name,, DALI ''friendly,, dali-fukuoka / ''name,, DALI ''friendly,, dali-tokyo

* When adding artists, the system will stop you if a band with that name already exists. To get around this, add some sort of differentiation to the ''name,, and ''romaji,,; once the artist is added, you can edit its page and remove the differentiation from the ''name,,, but leave it in the ''friendly,, name.



## Linking musicians to artists

* When an artist is added, the system will auto-link any musicians whose band history mentions that artist.

 Auto-linking is based on exact spelling, so it may miss some musicians or incorrectly link others. It's always good to double-check the artist page or to use the [musician search](/search/musicians/) function.
