## A primer for editors

* [Artists](https://vk.gy/artists/) and [releases](https://vk.gy/releases/) get their own links up top, but you can also access the [musicians](https://vk.gy/musicians/) and [labels](https://vk.gy/labels/) sections by going through the [database](https://vk.gy/database/).

 The [database](https://vk.gy/database/) page also allows you to quickly see all items that have been edited recently.

 There are also [comments](https://vk.gy/comments/), [documentation](https://vk.gy/documentation/), [images](https://vk.gy/images/), [livehouses](https://vk.gy/livehouses/), [users](https://vk.gy/users/), and [VIP](https://vk.gy/vip/) sections.

* [vkgy](https://vk.gy/) is designed to make it easy and quick to add information, while avoiding duplicates and weird formatting. The downside is that there's sometimes a learning curve.

 One of the first things you have to get used to is Markdown—a system for formatting text and linking artists. See **[Markdown](/documentation/markdown/)** for the full guide, but here's a quick primer on linking artists:

 In comments etc., you can make special artist links by enclosing their name between ''/slashes/,,. You can use romaji or Japanese, and can ommit symbols. The system will attempt to find that artist in the database and turn it into a working link in the final text:

 {/dali/, /sugar forkful/, and /la sadies/ are cool.}

* In each section, there's a link at the top-right to add to that section (e.g. “add artists”). If you're allowed to edit a certain page, the link for that will be at the top-right too.

 As each section has its own unique shortcuts and features, whenever you add to a section or edit a page, the relevant documentation will be available at the bottom of the page. You can always access *all* documentation [here](https://vk.gy/documentation/), or can ask for help [on Discord](https://discord.gg/jw8jzXn).

 It's often helpful to look at [recent edits](https://vk.gy/database/) and see how other users did them.

* Note that some additions to the database (upcoming releases, upcoming member changes, brand new bands) will automatically generate news posts about them. If a news post was generated, you'll be notified and will be able to edit it, if you want.
