## Introduction to editing

* There are many sections to which you can contribute information: [artists](https://vk.gy/artists/), [releases](https://vk.gy/releases/), [musicians](https://vk.gy/musicians/), [record labels](https://vk.gy/labels/), [livehouses](https://vk.gy/livehouses/), and [lives](https://vk.gy/lives/).

 Other useful sections are [comments](https://vk.gy/comments/), [documentation](https://vk.gy/documentation/), [images](https://vk.gy/images/), and [users](https://vk.gy/users/). VIP users may also access [change logs](https://vk.gy/vip/).

* For adding and editing information, [vkgy](https://vk.gy/) uses its own flavor of Markdown. It allows us to write in plain text and generate rich documents.

 For example, when leaving a comment, you can write an artist's name in ''/slashes/,,, and it will be converted into a link with the correct name. And in fact, as soon as you type ''/,,, a dropdown will appear which will help you type the artist's name more quickly.
 
 {/dali/ and /la sadies/ are cool.}

 See **[Markdown](/documentation/markdown/)** for more information.

* To add a page, navigate to the appropriate section and click the “add” link in the top right. To edit a page, navigate to that page and click “edit” in the top right.

 In most places, there are shortcuts to help you add data more quickly and easily. So be sure to check the relevant [documentation](https://vk.gy/documentation/) at the bottom of each page.
 
 Although we try to make editing as simple as possible, there is a learning curve. So please don't hesitate to ask for help [on Discord](https://discord.gg/jw8jzXn).

* Note that some additions to the database (upcoming releases, upcoming member changes, brand new bands) will automatically generate news posts about them. If a news post was generated, you'll be notified and will be able to edit it, if you want.
