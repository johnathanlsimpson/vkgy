				<li><span class="any__note">Foreign</span> must self-declare as “visual kei,” <em>and</em> appear somewhat visual, <em>and</em> be tangibly active (i.e. live concerts, paid releases).</li>
				<li><span class="any__note">Doujin</span> must self-declare as “visual kei,” <em>and</em> have visual artwork, <em>and</em> be tangibly active (i.e. paid releases).</li>

		<h2>
			Which name should be used
		</h2>
		<ul class="ul--bulleted text text--outlined">
			<li>The <span class="any__note">name</span> field is for the official name, and the <span class="any__note">romaji</span> field is for the romanization of the official name.<br /><br />i.e. 大日本鬼端児組 悪童会に占拠され ゴシップ → Dainippon Onitanjigumi Akudoukai ni Senkyosare GOSSIP</li>
			<li>Unlike Wikipedia et al., the official name must include any and all symbols/typesets that the band uses in their logo, if possible. If not possible, the closest substitute should be used.<br /><br />i.e. The Gazette → the GazettE, and cali<strong style="display:inline-block;margin-left:2px;transform:rotate(90deg);">≠</strong>gari → cali<strong>≠</strong>gari</li>
			<li>When romanizing the name, romanize only katakana/hiragana/kanji; all symbols should stay intact, if possible. If a band has an <em>official</em> romanization, use that instead.<br /><br />i.e. サリィ。 → SALLY。, and 愛狂います。 → Aikuruimasu。 → aicle。</li>
			<li>The <span class="any__note">friendly</span> field, which is only accessible when editing an artist, is for a url-friendly names (A-z, 0-9, hyphens). The “common name” may be used there.<br /><br />i.e. 大日本鬼端児組 悪童会に占拠され ゴシップ → Dainippon Onitanjigumi Akudoukai ni Senkyosare GOSSIP → gossip</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>
			Bands with the same name
		</h2>
		<ul class="ul--bulleted text text--outlined">
			<li>Bands with the same name can be differentiated by their <span class="any__note">friendly</span> name, which is accessed by editing the artist's page. The friendly name can be appeneded with the year they formed, city in which they were active, significant member, etc.<br /><br />i.e. <span class="any__note">name</span> AMETHYST → <span class="any__note">friendly</span> amethyst-1998 <span class="any__note">friendly</span> amethyst-kumamoto <span class="any__note">friendly</span> amethyst-duo</li>
			<li>If the system doesn't allow you to add the artist, you can temporarily put a differentiation in the artist name, then edit the name and friendly name after the artist is added.<br /><br />i.e. [add as] <span class="any__note">name</span> SALLY-2016 [then edit into] <span class="any__note">name</span> SALLY <span class="any__note">friendly</span> sally-2016</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>
			Auto-linking musicians to artists
		</h2>
		<ul class="ul--bulleted text text--outlined">
			<li>
				When a band is added, the database will attempt to automatically link any musicians who were in that band, based on the musician's band history.
			</li>
			<li>
				Auto-linking is based on exact spelling&mdash;so it may miss musicians whose band history spells the band name incorrectly. In those cases, the &ldquo;history&rdquo; field on the <a href="/search/musicians/">musician search page</a> can be helpful.
			</li>
			<li>
				Conversely, musicians may be <em>incorrectly</em> linked to a band if they were in a band of the exact same name. It's recommended to check the band's profile and make sure no musicians have been incorrectly linked.
			</li>
		</ul>
