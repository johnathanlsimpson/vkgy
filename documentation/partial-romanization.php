## Basic romanization

* At [vkgy](https://vk.gy/), a hybrid form of romanization is encouraged—*but not required*.

 The goal of vkgy is not to conform to academic journal standards, but to preserve the dumb visual gimmicks that vk bands employ. As such, the community has agreed upon a method which is easy for Western users to type, but which also preserves “visual intent.”

* [Modified Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) is recommended, except for long vowels, where Wapuro is recommended. ''お姉さん,, → ''oneesan,,, rather than onēsan.

* Avoid localizing symbols: don't convert “・・・” to “...” etc. If the symbol is not pronounced, it should probably stay the same in the romaji.

 Also avoid *introducing* typographic symbols that were not originally present, such as hyphens, apostrophes, or accent marks (hence Wapuro for long vowels).

* Official romanizations (as specified by the artist or lyrics) should take precedence—but note that iTunes (etc.) romaji is often done by third parties.

* In edge cases, just use your best judgment. You can also tag releases with ''needs romaji,,, or ask for help on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/jw8jzXn). Please *don't* argue with someone whose romanization you disagree with.



## Advanced romanization

* Loan words should be romanized to their original form: ''セーラー,, → ''sailor,,.

* Other than loan words, *translations* should be avoided: ''第一章,, → ''Daiisshou,, instead of “chapter one.”

 Also avoid romanizing anything other than katakana, hiragana, and/or kanji: ''第2章,, → ''Dai2shou,,.

 Katakana/hiragana/kanji that are used as *visual symbols* may be preserved: i.e. in ''(o_ _)ﾉ彡☆,,, the ﾉ and 彡 do *not* need to be romanized.

* It's recommended that hiragana (ひらがな) is written in lowercase and katakana (カタカナ) in UPPERCASE. This does not have an academic basis; it's purely to preserve the visual contrast that the artist intended.

* Aside from katakana, general English rules are suggested: capitalize titles and names, leave prepositions lowercase, etc.



## Archaic Japanese

* For obscure Japanese, the extended kana recommended by Hepburn are typically preferred.

 ''ヴ,, → ''VU,,, ''ル゜,, → ''LU,,.

* For archaic Japanese, it's recommended that the phrase be romanized how it would be *pronounced*. For example, てふてふ is actually an archaic way to write *chouchou* (and this is the recommended romanization), despite that those characters would be read tefutefu now.

* In weird cases like these, it's recommended that an explanatory note or comment be left. See the notes for this (1230)/mona lisa/ demotape, in which the first track is romanized differently than its characters would suggest:
