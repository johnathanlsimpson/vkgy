## Basics

* The ''name,, and ''romaji,, are for the official, base title; press and type fields can be accessed with the ''press/type,, button.

 If the release doesn't have an exact name, try to use whatever is written on the release itself, i.e. ''2019.08.06 コメントCD,,.

 In the event that the name is unknown, or hasn't been anounced, use a brief descriptor in parentheses: ''(unknown demotape),, ''(comment CD),, ''(single TBA),,.

* ''press,, is for additional *pressings*, which typically occur on separate dates. The “most official” press name should be used: usually however the band refers to the press in promotional material, i.e. “追加プレス” or “2ndプレス.”

* ''type,, is for when multiple types of a release were made available at the same time. Again, this should use the “most official” name, i.e. “TYPE-A” or “通常盤” or “RED VER.”

 If the type has no official designation, use the shortest possible differentiation, i.e. “赤” or “C”.

 In general, different covers signify different types, even if the band itself doesn't advertise the release as having multiple types. However, *inclusions* (e.g. trading cards or differntly-colored CDs) in a release do not count as types. Information about such inclusions can go in the ''notes,, section.

* ''artist,, is for the official artist. You can select /omnibus/ for omnibuses and coupling CDs.

 Note that it's possible for multiple artists to be on a non-omnibus CD: /kisaki kansai kizoku/ included one /anti feminism/ track on a CD, but the CD is clearly still by /kisaki kansai kizoku/.

 If the artist was using a different name at the time of the release, use the ''display name,, section to specify the old name.

* ''date,, can be blank, or just the year, or just the year and month (there's currently no way to be less specific, i.e. “90s”). You do not have to type the hyphens.

* ''price,, should be formatted ''xxxx yen,,. Separating commas are not necessary. You may also write “free.”



## Production details

* Both ''physical medium,, and ''format,, can have multiple values.

 Note that “CT” = “demotape.”

* ''venue,, can have only one selection.

 Note that “industry only” is for items that were *only* distributed to label producers, shop owners, etc.

* ''pressing,, refers to pressing limitation, and is usually specified by the band. This field can be left blank if the pressing wasn't limited in any way.

 ''copies made,, is the number of copies in that particular press. Separating comma is not necessary.

* The following fields are all related to companies, and can have multiple values, or none. This information usually comes from the back of the release, or from marketing material.

 The fields are in order from most-commonly-specified to least (left to right).

 * ''label,, is whichever label managed the artist at that time
 * ''publisher,, is whoever published (paid for) the release
 * ''distributor,, is who sent the release to stores
 * ''marketer,, is whoever was in charge of promotional material
 * ''manufacturer,, is who physically made the release
 * ''organizer,, is whoever planned the release



## Tracklist

* When you type in a tracklist name, the system will automatically search for other songs by that band, and give auto-complete suggestions. These suggestions will automatically fill in the romaji, if it was specified before.

 This only works if you already selected an artist, and does *not* work for omnibuses. Sorry!

* Click and hold the ''⮁,, button and drag to rearrange tracks. Click ''+,, to add a spot for a track directly below the current one.

* ''add tracks,, adds spaces for several additional tracks at once.

* ''add disc,, and ''add section,, will separate the tracklist into discs and sections, respectively.

 “Disc” is used generically here, and refers to separate items within the same set, e.g. CD and DVD.

 “Section” is used for sections *within one item*, e.g. “Side A” and “Side B” on the same demotape.

 All discs and sections need a name, even if it's as simple as “CD.” Again, use the “most official” name, or as brief a name as possible if no official name was provided.

* ''show artists,, gives the option to specify an artist for each track—this is useful for random guest appearances on releases. Omnibus releases have this option shown by default.

 ''show artist display names,, can be used if an artist appeared on a release, but under a different name. Note that ''display name,, within the “Basics” section should be used if the *entire* release was made by an artist under a different name.

 For tracks that don't really have an artist (e.g. an uncredited SE on an omnibus), you can put /omnibus/ as the artist (and add a display name if you wish).

* To save time, you can copy tracklists directly from websites and paste them into one of the tracklist boxes, and the system will automatically separate them. This works for tracklists in the following format:

 ''1. Song A\n2. Song B\n3. Song C,,

* ''clear tracklist,, is mainly useful when duplicating releases (see **[Advanced editing](/documentation/releases/#advanced-editing)**).



## Advanced editing

* If a release was cancelled, it should still be entered into the database: just add '' (cancelled),, at the end of the title.

* If a release was postponed, put the last date in the ''date,, field, but mention the original date and reason for delay in the ''notes,,.

* If a release was sold on multiple days (e.g. three lives in a row), use the first for ''date,, and list the others in ''notes,,.

 Note different presses/types must be entered as separate releases. Even if the band doesn't specify that they're multiple types, if there's *any* difference, it should be separate entries.

* You can add as many images as you'd like, just be sure to select ''default cover image,, for whichver one is the cover. For the others, you can add descriptions as necessary.

 You can delete images by double-clicking the trashcan icon.

 ''scanned by vkgy user,, should *only* be selected if you (or another user) scanned the image. These images will be watermarked with the username of whoever uploaded them.

* ''friendly url,, is a url-friendly name for the release. It's automatically generated, but you can edit it if you'd like. Letters, numbers, and hyphens are allowed.

* ''notes,, is for any random notes you have about the release. You can separate them with a horizontal line, and **[Markdown](/documentation/markdown/)** can be used.

 ''note 1\n\n---\n\n*another* note,, ''→,, [[<ul class="ul--compact" style="margin:0;"><li>note 1</li><li><em>another</em> note</li></ul>]]

* ''booklet credits,, is for the liner notes. For these, just type them however they appear in the booklet. Special formatting will be applied to any lines that are formatted like ''credit - name,,.

 ''Producer - KISAKI\nEngineer - Mr. Yamamoto\n\nSpecial thanks to...  you,, ''→,, [[<span class="any__note">Producer</span> KISAKI<br /><span class="any__note">Engineer</span> Mr. Yamamoto<br /><br />Special thanks to... you]]

* ''concept/tagline,, is for when the artist specified a concept for the release. This is usually found on the obi or flyer, and was mostly only a trend with kote bands.

* ''jan code,, is for the number under the barcode.

* After hitting ''submit,,, you can immediately view the release or click ''edit,, to fix any mistakes.

 Clicking ''duplicate,, will keep all of the information, but as a new release. This is useful mainly for quickly entering multi-type releases. The ''friendly url,, will be cleared, but all information will stay the same until you edit it and ''submit,, again.

 ''clear tracklist,, can often be useful when duplicating releases.

* If you added a release that isn't out yet, a blog entry may be generated for that release. In that case, you'll be notified, and will have the option to edit the blog entry, if you wish. Any additional releases added on the same day by the same artist will be automatically added to the blog post.
